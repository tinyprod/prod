 * Inspection of cpu header files shows that the following defines exist.

 * which timer module.   Modules seen: TA3, T0A3, T0A5, T1A2, T1A3, T1A5, 
 * T2A3, T0B7, T0D3, T1D3.   Which modules are actually present depends
 * on which chip is being used and is reflected in the cpu header file.
 *
 * All supported x5 (msp430xv2) chips support T0An, so we'll use that
 * for the 32KHz timer suite.  If you clone this to a platform area,
 * remember to also clone Msp430Counter32khzC if you change to a
