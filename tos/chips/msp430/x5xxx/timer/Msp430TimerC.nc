/*
 * TinyOS Msp430 support started with the msp430f1611 which provided
 * 1 TA3 (3 CCRs) and 1 TB7 (7 CCRs).   The cc430 and 5438 cpus (both x5)
 * provide a T0A5 and T1A3 but no TBs.  Other chips in the MSP430XV2
 * series have different suites.  Current TI headers indicate the
 * following sets are available:
 *
 * T0A3, T0A5
 * T1A2 T1A3 T1A5
 * T2A3
 * T0B7
 * T0D3, T1D3
 *
 * TA3 is also defined but not in any of the x5 cpu headers.   This may
 * become an issue when we start to support the x4 family.
 *
 * Timer_B extends Timer_A with some extra features that are not
 * currently supported in TinyOS.  Until those features are needed,
 * Timer_B instances use the same interfaces as Timer_A instances.
 * Ditto for Timer_D.
 *
 * @note As of this writing, only T0A5 and T1A3 have been tested.
