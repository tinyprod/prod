Socket Interface for TinyOS Network Communications
===============================================================================

MoteNet implements a socket interface for communications with a wireless
sensor network.   Any network stack supported by both the mote and base
station can be supported.  Currently, IPv6 and TinyOS Active Messaging (AM)
sockets are supported.

Motivation: Many network cognizant programs are implemented using a socket
interface.  This isolates most of the details of network communications behind
the sockets abstraction barrier.

There is work in progress to implement an IPv6/6lowpan stack on the motes.
Interfacing to this network from the base station consists of a socket
interface to a IPv6 network.  This has many benefits.

MoteNet provides the same interface for programs built on top of the AM
protocol stack.  The AM stack provides a significantly lighter weight network
transport than the ipv6/6lowpan stack.

Normally just the payload crosses the socket interface (specified via
SOCK_DGRAM), however the whole AM packet can be requested by using SOCK_RAW.

See mnlisten.c and mnsend.c for working examples.


Usage of the interface looks like the following:


struct sockaddr_am local_addr, remote_addr;

mn_parse_motecom(&mcs_conn, "serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:115200");
sock_fd = mn_socket(&mcs_conn, AF_AM, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
memset(&local_addr,  0, sizeof(local_addr);
memset(&remote_addr, 0, sizeof(remote_addr);
local_addr.am_family   = AF_AM;
local_addr.am_am_addr  = htons(0x0001);
local_addr.am_type     = 0xa1;		 /* only receive for type A1 (161) */

remote_addr.am_family  = AF_AM;
remote_addr.am_am_addr = htons(0xffff);	/* broadcast */
remote_addr.am_type    = 0xa1;

/* set local address, also opens the serial port */
err = mn_bind(sock_fd, &local_sockaddr, sizeof(local_sockaddr));

/* set remote end's address, we will broadcast */
err = mn_connect(sock_fd, &remote_sockaddr, sizeof(remote_sockaddr));

/* will receive any packets addressed to 0x0001 or 0xffff */
num_recvd = mn_recv(sock_fd, buf, 1024, 0);


Each mn_recv() will receive the next complete packet.   Each mn_send() will
send one complete packet.  mn_recvfrom() will receive the next packet but also
returns the address of the sender (this is the AM address in the src field).
Similarily, a different destination address can be specified for the send
using mn_sendto().


The directory contains all files to build the library (libmotenet.a) that
provides the socket interface and lower layer code that implements direct
access to the serial port as well as the interconnect to the remote server.

Two example programs are also included that demonstrate usage of the library
and the socket interface.

The Active Message stack in TinyOS 2.1 implements a light weight
network protocol for a wireless sensor network.  Its header follows:

      +--------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+---------
      | encap  | dest | src | len | grp | type | payload
      +--------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+---------
bytes     1       2      2     1     1     1       len

encap == 0x00
