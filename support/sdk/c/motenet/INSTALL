First, build and install netlib (../netlib)

To install using stow:

      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/stow/motenet
      make

      sudo -s
      make install

      ("sudo make install" for some reason doesn't pick up the value of $TOSROOT properly so
      the make install doesn't work right unless you are root first)

      This will install bin/{mnlisten, mnsend}, include/motenet.h, and lib/libmotenet.a.
      Install also installs message.h, serialsource.h, and sfsource.h from ../sf for
      backward compatibility. These are installed into /opt/stow/motenet.


   Install into /opt/{bin,include,lib} using stow.  (still root)

      cd /opt/stow
      stow motenet


Alternative Installation:

      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --prefix=/opt
      make

      sudo -s
      make install

      If no prefix is given, it will default to /usr/local.
