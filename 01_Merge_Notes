The phrase "trunk-Z1" refers to the Z1 commit into the main t2 svn trunk.  T2 SVN trunk commits
5442-5446 (corresponding git SHAs: 95e34ad, 7c460e2, 33fcc13, 4496245, and e50ad32.

By direct comparison, the trunk Z1 commit is 98% z1-sf 0.16.  A few missing things, nothing important
but the msp430 branch brought those things back in.   See the following commit for the missing parts:

    270f0cc Z1 changes outside main z1 modifications (outside tos/{chips,platforms}


1) created the branch master-vhsb (master with vogon hyper spatial bypass).  The hyper-spatial bypass
   jumps over the trunk-Z1 code (deletes it).

2) removed trunk-Z1 commit.   Gets in the way of the collapse work already done.  See the following:

    c2e52bd Remove extra Z1 commit.   Reverse 5442 (95e34ad)
    2724902 Remove extra Z1 commit.   Reverse 5444 (33fcc13) and 5443 (7c460e2)
    978a1d9 Remove extra Z1 commit.   Reverse 5446 (e50ad32) and 5445 (4496245)

3) brought in code from sourceforge z1-0.16 that changed things but didn't hit the main areas for
   the Z1.  ie.  stuff outside of tos/chips/msp430.   See:

    270f0cc Z1 changes outside main z1 modifications (outside tos/{chips,platforms}

4) brought in Z1 code that is required (non-duplicate):

    1e1249a bring adxl345 and tmp102 into tos/chips
    4e89d73 move z1-0.16 tos/platforms/z1 into msp430 (mm-z1)


5) brought in z1 code that effects tos/chips/msp430.   But avoided the duplicates.  (z1-0.16 code
   checked against the trunk Z1 code (removed above) to see if anything missing).


* In apps/IPBaseStation/BaseStationP.nc, Z1 brought in #include CC2420.h that is inside
  an #ifndef SIM.   Why the ifndef?

* want to check tos/platforms/z1/<stuff>  for duplicates vs. tos/chips/msp430 when done integrating
  and collapsing.

* might want to add Zolertia copyrights to adxl345 and tmp102.

* Z1 msp430hardware.h commented out the defines for I2CBUSY but the main msp430/msp430hardware.h
  doesn't.   Where should the I2C stuff be defined?

  For the time being, if this causes problems for Z1 then need to have per cpu family msp430hardware.h
  files.  Or do it with an #ifdef (PLATFORM_Z1)

* TinyOS timing is based on powers of 2.  The Z1 used the calibration constants provided by TI but
  these constants give timing that are base 10.   This has been changed in the merge.

* removed tos/platforms/z1/chips/msp430/timers from z1/.platform.   Let Z1 use the clock_bcs
  driver.   This also disables use of Z1 version of Msp430TimerCapComP (uses scs, syncronous for
  capturing).   z1/Msp430ClockP renamed to z1/Msp430ClockP_TLV.
