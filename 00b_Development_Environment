Installing a development environment for TinyOS (TinyProd).


State:

2011-12-16:
    Ubuntu 10.04 - 12.04.   Debian Squeeze works as well.
    Tested directly on 10.04 and 11.10, (12.04 in progress)

    T2 (TinyProd) github:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int),
    mspdebug JTAG debugging.   mspgcc-LTS20110716 toolchain with patches
    Toolchain from http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian-dev

**************************************************************************************

This brief is written assuming that there is a common root directory,
we'll call it "top" and it is usually at the top level of a working
directory.  ie.  ~/top.   You can put this directory anywhere, environment
variables are used to tell the tools where things live.

Most commands are entered from a terminal window.

**************************************************************************************

1) OS Install.

Development is only supported on Linux hosts, in particular the Ubuntu and/or Debian
strains.  Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.10 have been directly tested (on Apple MacBookPro laptops).
Ubuntu 12.04 is currently being tested.  Mac support can be added to 10.04 and 10.10 and
is included directly in 11.10 and later versions.   (MacBookPro 3,1 has been directly
tested).

Obtain an ISO image from releases/ubuntu.com or alternatively from tinyprod.net/downloads.
Burn the iso to a CD and install on your box.  A simple install is fine and will
take less time.

When the install is complete, boot the system, and use "apt-get" to install the following
packages:

    build-essential stow automake autoconf libtool libc6-dev
    git-core git-daemon-run git-doc git-email git-gui gitk gitmagic
    openssh-client openssh-server

The following will do the trick:

sudo -s
apt-get install build-essential stow automake autoconf libtool libc6-dev
apt-get install git-core git-daemon-run git-doc git-email git-gui gitk gitmagic
apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
exit


**************************************************************************************

2) Install the TinyOS toolset (msp430)

We want the tinyos toolset for msp430 based motes (ie, telosb, msp430f1611). Debian packages
are available from Stanford and TinyProd.net.   The toolchain at TinyProd.Net as of
(April 4, 2012) is more up to date.

We want the following packages:

           nesc
           msp430-binutils-tinyos
           msp430-gcc-tinyos
	   msp430-gdb-tinyos
           msp430-libc-tinyos
           msp430-tinyos
	   msp430mcu-tinyos
	   mspdebug-tinyos
	   tinyos-tools

You want to follow the instructions at: http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian.

The following should be equivilent.  With some additions...

#
# add the keys for Razvan, the package signer
#
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys F99BE531
gpg -a --export F99BE531 | sudo apt-key add -

sudo -s

#
# teach dpkt/apt-get/aptitude about where to find the tinyprod tools repository
#
echo "deb http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian squeeze main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tinyprod-debian.list
apt-get update
apt-get install nesc msp430-tinyos mspdebug-tinyos tinyos-tools
exit

**************************************************************************************

3) TinyOS 2.x tree checkout

This is a basic check out of the msp430-int branch of the github repository
tp-freeforall/prod.git.   This repo tracks the main tinyos SVN repository used
for development.   It has modifications to support newer TI MSP430 processors.

This basic checkout gives you a read-only copy of the msp430-int branch.   It
is a fully functional local repository that can be commited into (locally only).

    cd ~/top
    mkdir t2_cur
    cd t2_cur
    git clone -v git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git checkout -b <your_initials>

This will create a new branch named <your_intials> and will check you into that branch.
It will be branched off of the main branch from the remote, gh:tp-freeforall/prod
(msp430-int).

This will keep your changes locally grouped.   You will have a remote named 'origin'
that points at the repository that you cloned from namely,
git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.git.   Your branch <your_initials> will be rooted
at the default branch of tp-freeforall/prod, msp430-int.

To set up for contibuting to the main repository, the instructions in
00c_Getting_Started_Git and 00d_Contribution_Process should be followed.

**************************************************************************************

4) Set up build environment settings

The following environment variables must be set to build.

    TOSROOT
    TOSDIR
    MAKERULES
    CLASSPATH

    for example:  working dir ~/top
  
  	#!/bin/sh
  
  	MOTECOM="serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb"
  
  	TOSROOT=~/top/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x
  	TOSDIR=$TOSROOT/tos
  
  	MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
  	CLASSPATH=.:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
  
  	PYTHONPATH=$TOSROOT/support/sdk/python:$PYTHONPATH
  
  	export MAKERULES TOSDIR TOSROOT CLASSPATH PYTHONPATH
  	export MOTECOM


**************************************************************************************

5) Do a test compile.

    For telosb hardware:  (assumes pluged in to a USB port)

    cd ~/top/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x/apps/Blink
    make telosb install

    The Leds should start to blink.


**************************************************************************************

6) Build SerialForwarder and libmote library.   (optional)

WARNING:  This should get replaced with libmotenet.   Superset of the SF but also
allows using AM sockets or IPv6 sockets for connections.  Note: currently libmotenet
is a work in progress and should be considered experimental.


    Build the serial forwarder and associated library (also includes direct serial access)

      cd $TOSROOT/support/sdk/c/sf
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/stow/sf_c
      make

      sudo -s
      make install

      ("sudo make install" for some reason doesn't pick up the value of $TOSROOT properly so
      the make install doesn't work write unless you are root first)

      This will install bin/{sf, sflisten, sfsend, seriallisten, serialsend}, include/{message.h,
      serialsource.h, sfsource.h}, and lib/libmote.a.  These will be installed into /opt/stow/sf_c.


   Install into /opt/{bin,include,lib} using stow.

      cd /opt/stow
      stow sf_c


**************************************************************************************

7) We use GIT as the SCM.  Here are some pointers to get you started:

    http://docs.tinyos.net/index.php/Getting_started


**************************************************************************************

8) Using the serialforwarder/seriallistener

    a) make sure that tinyos.jar has been built.  It should live in $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
    b) to rebuild:
  
       cd $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/
       make tinyos.jar
  
    c) Install TOSComm JNI support if needed.  Did java bitch about not finding TOSComm JNI support?
  
       assuming tinyos-tools is installed run:
  
       tos-install-jni
  
    d) To watch raw bytes coming from the serial port
  
       Make sure CLASSPATH includes $TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar, ie:
  
           CLASSPATH=.:/home/joe/mm/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar

execute:

       java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb


And you should see packets that look something like this:  (depends on what the mote is sending)

            00 FF FF 00 00 12 00 A1 00 12 07 09 00 0C 9E 23 00 0C 9E 30 F6 2C FF D7 FF FF

            ^  ^     ^     ^  ^  ^  ^     ^  ^  | -- sensor 8 data
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |     |  |- sensor id
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |     |- sensor data type
            |  |     |     |  |  |  |-- length of data block
            |  |     |     |  |  |-- AM type MM_DT (data, typed)
            |  |     |     |  |-- AM group
            |  |     |     |-- serial length
            |  |     |-- src addr           
            |  |-- dest addr
            |-- dispatch byte - 0 says AM
                             
If you define MOTECOM you won't need to specify the -comm parameter.  ie:

       MOTECOM=serial@/dev/ttyUSB1:telosb

See $(TOSROOT)/00a_Repo_Notes for details about how the TinyProd/prod repo is organized.
github:tinyprod/prod or github:tp-freeforall/prod hold the main t2 repository.
